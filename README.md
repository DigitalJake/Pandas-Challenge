# PyCity Schools 

![cute-panda-go-school_29190-1681](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120591725/231637299-0c061406-603e-407f-ac92-959a0b70b1d5.jpg)




In this ficitional set up, I'm the new Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district. In this capacity, I assist with helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Using data on every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, I'm asked to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Please locate the "Analysis" file in the PyCitySchools folder for helpful insghts from the analysis. 
The script was completed using Jupyter notebooks for easy data frame viewing. 



# District Summary




Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)



# School Summary




Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

This analysis compares school size with school spending. 
Through the data manipulation process, we have learned some fundemental truths from the data sets based on school size and spending. 
The data sets provide enough variety and sample size in the data with multiple schools in each section to perform a healthy and fact-based analysis. 

My findings include: 


                                ---School Size---
                - Larger schools performing considerabley worse in many sections and overal passing percentage.
                - Math scores were particularly poor in larger schools compared to medium and small schools.
        


                                ---School Spending---
                - Schools with less per capita spending generated noticeabley higher average scores and overall passing.
                - Higher per capita spending is most likely linked to larger schools, meaning that increased spending doesn't affect overall passing but smaller class sizes do.
